This repository contains a number of text pre- and post-processing utilities written
in the context of the Portage project. Since they are frequently useful outside that
context, we have separated them into this repository that is trivial to install.

## Installation

Clone this repo to the location of your choice and add this line to your .profile or .bashrc:

`source /path/to/PortageTextProcessing/SETUP.bash`

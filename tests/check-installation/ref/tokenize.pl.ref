Usage: tokenize.pl [-v] [-p] -ss|-noss [-notok] [-lang=l] [in [out]]

  Tokenize and sentence-split text in ISO-8859-1 (iso latin 1).

Options:

-v    Write vertical output, with each token followed by its index relative to
      the start of its paragraph, <sent> markers after sentences, and <para>
      markers after each paragraph.
-p    Print an extra newline after each paragraph (has no effect if -v)
-ss   Perform sentence-splitting.
-noss Don't perform sentence-splitting.
      Note: one of -ss or -noss is now required, because the old default (-ss)
      often caused unexpected behaviour.
-notok Don't perform tokenization. [do]
-lang Specify two-letter language code: en or fr [en]
-paraline
      File is in one-paragraph-per-line format [no]

Caveat:

  With -ss, consecutive non-blank lines are considered as a paragraph: newlines
  within the paragraph are removed and sentence splitting is performed.  To
  increase sentence splitting accuracy, try to preserve existing paragraph
  boundaries in your text, separating them with a blank line (i.e., two
  newlines), or using -paraline if your input contains one paragraph per line.

  To preserve existing line breaks, e.g., if your input is already
  one-sentence-per-line, use -noss, otherwise your sentence breaks will be
  modified in ways that are almost certainly undesirable.

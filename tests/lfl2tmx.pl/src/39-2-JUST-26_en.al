Committee 
<Affiliation> The Chair ( Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , CPC ) ) </Affiliation> : 
I'd like to call the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights to order . 
If I could ask the camera crew to move to the far end of the hall , I would appreciate it . 
This being Wednesday , May 14 , 2008 , pursuant to Standing Order 106(4) , this meeting is requested by four members of the committee to discuss their request to proceed to the vote on the appeal of the ruling of the chair concerning the motion moved by the member from Beauséjour on March 11 , 2008 . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Brian Murphy ( Moncton — Riverview — Dieppe , Lib. ) </Affiliation> : 
A point of order on in camera -- 
<Affiliation> The Chair </Affiliation> : 
Committee members , I'm recognizing no one right now . 
I'm not finished my statement . 
This meeting , like the last meeting , is convened under Standing Order 106(4) . 
Today 's meeting was scheduled after the clerk received a letter signed by various members ; I think it was all of the opposition members , the Liberal and the Bloc . 
On Friday -- 
<Affiliation> Mr. Brian Murphy </Affiliation> : 
Sorry , Mr. Chair , on a point of order . 
<Affiliation> The Chair </Affiliation> : 
I'm not recognizing anyone until I've finished my statement . 
Then your point of order will be -- 
<Affiliation> Mr. Brian Murphy </Affiliation> : 
It 's on the cameras . 
Let 's make this simple . 
I don't want to interrupt your statement , but this is not an in camera meeting , Mr. Chair . 
So can we have cameras back in the meeting ? 
<Affiliation> The Chair </Affiliation> : 
I never asked the gentleman with the camera to leave the room ; I asked him to move to the end of the hall . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Brian Murphy </Affiliation> : 
If that 's a clear ruling , I misunderstood , because they left thinking it was .. I apologize . 
<Affiliation> The Chair </Affiliation> : 
Let me continue .

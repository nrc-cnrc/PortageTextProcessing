EVIDENCE 
September 26 , 2006 
Committee 
<Affiliation> La greffière du comité ( Mme Diane Diotte ) </Affiliation> : 
Honourable members of the committee , 
I see a quorum . 
We can now proceed to the election of the chair , and I am ready to receive motions to that effect . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Derek Lee ( Scarborough — Rouge River , Lib. ) </Affiliation> : 
A point of order . 
Maybe the clerk isn't in a position to receive a point of order . 
Are you ? 
It 's because I take the view that last time we met last week we had a chair ; we had a chair this week . 
There 's been no hiatus in the chair holding the office of the chair , and there is no instruction in the Standing Orders . 
There are no words that require the committee to actually elect a chair , unless we need to , and since the chair was the chair last week -- and perhaps the clerk could refresh us on when the reports referred to were filed , but in my view it doesn't matter -- the Standing Orders do not anywhere explicitly require the election of a chair who is already a chair , nor do they require the election of vice-chairs who are already vice-chairs . 
The wording of Standing Order 106(2) clearly says that these elections shall take place at the beginning of a session , which this is not , and if necessary , which in my view it is not , since there 's been no change in the membership of the chair or the vice-chairs . 
So I make my point of order . 
I have done it before and I'll probably do it again , and if the chair wants to go through .. We can elect a chair without taking a whole lot more time . 
I've made my point of order . 
We can re-elect the chair and everybody will be happy . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , CPC ) </Affiliation> : 
Let 's go through the election of the chair and whatever happens after . 
<Affiliation> The Clerk </Affiliation> : 
I am ready to receive motions for the election of the Chair . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , CPC ) </Affiliation> : 
Madam Chair , I nominate Art Hanger for chair . 
<Affiliation> The Clerk </Affiliation> : 
It has been moved by Mr. Thompson and seconded by Mr. Lee that Mr. Hanger be elected as chair of the committee . 
Are there any further motions ? 
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the motion ? 
( Motion agreed to ) 
<Affiliation> The Clerk </Affiliation> : 
Mr. Hanger has been duly elected chair of the committee . 
Before inviting Mr. Hanger to take the chair as chair , we will now proceed to the election of the vice-chairs , if there 's agreement to do it . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Derek Lee </Affiliation> : 
I don't agree , Madam Clerk , that it's necessary to re-elect the vice-chairs either , for the same reason , and the clerk would be at pains to find any wording in the Standing Orders that requires it . 
<Affiliation> The Clerk </Affiliation> : 
I'm in the hands of the committee . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Derek Lee </Affiliation> : 
The member opposite says let 's do it anyway . 
I object on principle . 
There are reasons related to how we run the House and who 's in control of what around here , but if members are more comfortable blindly following what I regard as an incorrect interpretation of the Standing Orders , I'm okay to follow because it will save a lot of time . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Réal Ménard ( Hochelaga , BQ ) </Affiliation> : 
Madam Clerk , I move that the same vice-chairs be reappointed . 
<Affiliation> The Clerk </Affiliation> : 
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the motion ? 
( Motion agreed to ) 
<B> The Clerk : </B> Messrs. Lee and Ménard are therefore reappointed vice-chairs . 
I'm inviting Mr. Hanger to take the chair . 
<Affiliation> Mr. Réal Ménard </Affiliation> : 
No speech . 
<Affiliation> The Chair </Affiliation> : 
The time for speeches has passed . 
I'm going to give you the opportunity here shortly , all of you . 
I would first like to thank my colleagues on both sides , opposition as well as government side , for their continued support of me in the chair 's position . 
Right now we will adjourn briefly for two minutes . 
The witnesses will then take their seats and everything will be recorded at this point . 
Ms. Barnes . 
<Affiliation> Hon. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib. ) </Affiliation> : 
Mr. Hanger , after the witnesses have finished today I would like to have just a couple of minutes to take care of a business item . 
I would like to let everybody know that , but in relation to our witnesses we should do those first . 
<Affiliation> The Acting Chair ( The Chair ) </Affiliation> : 
Yes . 
We will look after our business at the end of this session . 
The meeting is adjourned .

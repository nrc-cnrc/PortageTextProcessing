## Usage: which-test.sh PROG
## Exits with status code 0 if PROG is on the path and executable, 1 otherwise.
## Example use in a bash or sh script:
##    if which-test.sh PROG; then
##       # PROG is available; you can use it
##    else
##       # PROG doesn't exist, isn't on the path, or isn't executable;
##       # work around it or give up
##    fi
##
## Options:
##
##  -h       print this help message
##  -v       print verbose output
##
## Motivation for this script: on some Solaris and Mac installations, "which"
## does not return a fail status code when the program doesn't exist.  This
## script has been tested and works correctly on Solaris, Mac OS X, and various
## Linux distros.

# Hack: we detect that we're running on a cluster by looking for jobsub or qsub.
# Defining the PORTAGE_NOCLUSTER environment variable to a non-empty string
# hides jobsub/qsub globally by altering what this script returns.
